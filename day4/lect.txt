Express - it's middlewares

Middleware

It's a function which has access to the req object, the res object and has a next function

app.use(middleware)

Middleware works for *all* the routes/endpoints defined below it

Custom middlewares : - we write our logic
In the middleware function, we can write our own logic as per our need
Ex : timer, logger, gatekeeper etc

Express inbuilt middlewares : 
Middlewares that exist within express
Ex : express.json(), express.text()


Community/external middleware : 
Ex : cors(), multer

CORS - cross origin resource sharing

client's orgin - react app on codesandbox
server's origin - localhost 8500
